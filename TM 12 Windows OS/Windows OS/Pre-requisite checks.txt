1. 
Select the Start  button, then select Settings > System > About .
Open About settings

At the right, under Device specifications, see System type.

win key +R>type msinfo32>enter

If it is 64 bit it will say so otherwise it is 32bit

Then the "System Information" is running.
Then as ZigZag3143's picture, under "System Summary", you could find that the "System Type" is "x64-based PC" (or "x86-based PC", or others).

Also could execute the following operations in the graphical interface tool to get the same results:
Right-click Start button (or press-and-hold Start button, or press Win+X), then click "System" (or tap "System", or Press Y),
then "Control Panel\System and Security\System" window pops up, for example, I could find the following words in it:
"System type: 64 bit Operating System, x64-based processor"
Note：within the prompts above, before the comma, the "64 bit" points to the operating system's software architecture type; after the comma, the "x64-based" points to the computer's hardware architecture type.
(BTW, also could right-click Start button, then click "Control Panel", then select "Control Panel -> System and Security -> System", can get the same results too.)

The command line operation below can get the same results too.
Could open a "Command Prompt (Admin)" window by one of the following three ways ('I. Keyboard' or 'II. Mouse' or 'III. Touch'):
I. Keyboard: Win+X, A, Alt+Y
II. Mouse: rightclick Start button, click "Command Prompt (Admin)", click "Yes" button
III. Touch: press-and-hold Start button, tap "Command Prompt (Admin)", tap "Yes" button

Then in the "Command Prompt (Admin)" window, could run the following command to view the software architecture type of OS:
[Type or paste the command]
wmic os get osarchitecture
[Hit or press the Enter key]
(
By the way, also could run the following command to view the hardware architecture type of PC:
[Type or paste the command]
wmic computersystem get systemtype
[Hit or press the Enter key]
)
